            <h3>Our history</h3>
            <p>
              Since its inception, the history of the Toronto Zoo has been a
              tale of unwavering dedication to wildlife conservation, education,
              and unforgettable experiences. Established in 1974, the zoo has
              evolved from a modest collection of animals into a global leader
              in zoological excellence.<br /><br />

              The Toronto Zoo's story is one of growth and innovation. Situated
              on sprawling grounds that mirror diverse ecosystems from around
              the world, the zoo has continuously expanded its exhibits and
              habitats to provide animals with environments that closely
              resemble their natural homes. From the majestic African Savanna to
              the immersive Tundra Trek, each exhibit is a testament to our
              commitment to animal welfare and educational engagement.<br /><br />

              Our history is deeply intertwined with milestones of conservation.
              Through strategic partnerships with international organizations
              and collaborations with experts in the field, the Toronto Zoo has
              played a pivotal role in numerous critical initiatives to protect
              endangered species and ecosystems.
